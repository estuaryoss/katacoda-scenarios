The estuary-cicd can be used to execute small ci/cd flows.   
The concept is similat with Jenkins. We have here a net of
Agents similar with the Jenkins slaves. Each Agent can be centralized in a Eureka registry similar with the Jenkins
master.  

To summarize the cicd CLI is able to:  

- run commands locally inside the CLI  
- run commands remotely on the Agent  
- upload files & execute them remotely on the Agent  
- download files from the Agent
