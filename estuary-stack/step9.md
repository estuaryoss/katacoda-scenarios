Estuary viewer is a dashboard to view the stack in real time:  
- the type of services currently registered in the same Eureka domain
- viewing active deployments
- viewing background command sessions

You can deploy the Viewer local laptop and check the insights it offers. The stack can be in cloud or in K8s, or on your local domain.
