This concludes the estuary stack. The stack is available as binaries to be deployed on VMs also.  

The stack is suitable for:
- distributed test/dev infrastructure for companies that adopt and develop their tests in docker
- distributed test infrastructure in Kubernetes  
- on-prem or cloud development & testing  
- traffic generator (E.g. wrk performance testing)
- test spread on multiple machines 
- etc 

The stack fully complies with K8s.
