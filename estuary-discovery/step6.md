In this step we will see all the commands (active or ended) in the web view. The endpoint is called **/viewer**.

Open the web here from here:  
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8081-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/viewer

! Note: The web view is per Discovery service, unlike [Viewer](https://github.com/estuaryoss/estuary-viewer) which can aggregate multiple Discovery(ies),
thus presenting stacks deployed in multiple Eureka domains.
